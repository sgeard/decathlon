# decathlon

This is my solution to The Register's 2016 programming challenge written in Fortran. There is also a tcl script to generate test data.

See http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/21/programming_competition_roundup

## Building

If you have an Intel compiler build the program using

* make decathlon

or if you have gfortran use

* make decathlon_gf

## Running

The program reads an input file Decathlon.dat and creates an output file Decathlon.out. There is no output whilst it is running.
